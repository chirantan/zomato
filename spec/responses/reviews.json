The ambience is just as serene and soothing.\nThe menu offers  a variety of south indian dishes. The staff is extremely courteous and polite and work hard to give you a relaxing and enjoyable time at the restaurant.\nThe must try items in their menu are - WaterMelon Juice, Mysore Masala Dosa, Kesari Bhat.\nDo not miss those small pans at the end. Although they charge extra for it, but they're worth the amount."

				"reviewText": "As a North Indian who always loved South Indian food, and had a chance to relearn my South Indian food palate after living in a small south Indian city for 5years, i kind of feel entitled to write this review.\n\nI have lost count of the number of times i have been to Naivedyam. I have no hesitation in recommending this as the most authentic South Indian \"tiffin\" restaurant i have been to in Delhi. The food is authentic, simple and clean, there is a slight tilt towards a more Kannadika style of tiffin items. They are one of the few restaurants in Delhi that can do an excellent Mysore Masala Dosai and they pull it off with ease here.\nA common problem that i have with South Indian restaurants in Delhi is the modification of the tastes, a north Indian sambar tends to taste more spicy, loaded with Dal and thick in consistency as compared to the authentic tangy south indian sambar, with more large cut veggies and more like a thin soup like in consistency. Naivedyam successfully acomplishes preserving the authentic taste and this is probably the most un-northindianized south Indian food ive had in Delhi.\n\nHaving said that, there is more than just the food that makes me give it a 5star rating. The restaurant is tucked away into a silent quiet niche among the hustle and bustle of Hauz Khas. Once you have reached the place, it is obvious to see that they put an effort into the external decor, lined with idols, banana tree leaves arching over the entrance and a very inviting aroma paired with a traditional diya lamp. In short, the exterior is inviting, and i cannot think that anyone would not want to walk in if you were to pass by hungry or looking for food.\n\nThe seating and the internal decor is also very comfortable and cozy, the walls and even the roof have been decorated well with typical south indian art and architectural elements that complement the decor. The music inside adds to the ambiance without being intruding. But be warned they are very full despite having a seating capacity of about 60ish people. Even on weekdays they manage about a 80% occupancy. But do not worry their service is very prompt and they can easily manage about 3-4 covers per table on an average night, the longest I've ever waited is about 45mins on a late weekend night, which i thought was acceptable.\n\nTheir food however is their major strength, as i highlighted before. They offer complimentary Rasam (Mulligatawny Soup) and Appalams (Fried Rice paddadoms) as you get to your table. They offer a whole range of Idlis, Vadai, Dosais, South Indian rice's and Oothapams. The menu is clearly laid out and each dish has appropriate explanations for first timers. The dishes are appropriately priced and sometimes i wonder if they are a little under-priced (but never complain) for a restaurant of such pedigree in south delhi. The waiters are helpful, speak english and are more than happy to help you sort out your order.\nFor anyone going there for the first time, i highly recommend the Mysore Masala Dosai. I cannot say enough about how awesome it is. Their idlis are also to die for. They offer authentic south indian deserts (limited) and south indian filter coffee to end your meal on a high note.\n\nTo Summarize\nAccess (parking, locatability) - 7/10\nExterior - 9/10\nInterior - 9/10\nService - 9/10\nFood - 11/10 (yes thats not a typo)\nPrices - 10/10\nOverall - 10/10\n\nThe only thing i could think might go against this restaurant is that the food is too definitive and people who have been raised on North Indianized South Indian food, whose taste buds have been violated might not be able to appreciate the simplicity and authenticity."

A cute idol of nandi, with a beautiful lit lamp, matched with incense sticks burning, makes for quite an entrance!\n\nThe seating inside is warm and pleasant, lovely paintings adorn the walls. I was surprised to see on a Wednesday night, it had some 70% occupancy. There is classical music playing in the background adding to the whole appeal of the place.\n\nEach table is served with a welcome drink (Rasam) and an appetizer (Fried Papad). The rasam is breathtaking. Together the combination of rasam and papad, make for an excellent start to the meal.\n\nNaivedyam serves the regular south Indian food, its only vegetarian. They have everything from Idlis, vadas, upma, pongal (during the day), dosai varieties, oothapams, types of rice, appams. There are Dosai specialities like the tangam paper dosai, panchtantra dosai which is set dosai, erulli masala is with onions, maharaja dosai is with dry fruits. Rice varieties include the lemon rice, bisbele bath, tamarind rice. It is decently priced for delhi standards. Idlis are for 70, vadai (80), Rice (90). Average meal for two is about 400 bucks.\n\nWe ordered a plate of Vegetable Idli, masala Vadai and Mysore Masala Dosa. The Veg Idli was okay, masala vadai was decent, so was the mysore masala. One of the best masalas I have had. The accompaniments, only the coconut chutney was good. The Sambhar was bland, too much water, the malgapudi was a disappointment.\n\nFor desserts we had the Kesari Bhath, and it was just too good. Perfect in fact, the right amount of sweet, less ghee, a must have! Also Try their filter coffee too, does not let you down.\n\nOh and now for the most amazing part. Naivedyam accepts Sodexho coupons, so all the good food, nice ambiance, it is not a bad deal at all. In fact, if you somewhere near Hauz Khas and in a mood for idli, vadai and dosai, go to this place.\n\n\nCheers!"

My plan was to try both Masala Dosa and Uttapam but...\n\nThe place is amazingly designed, with Paintings from old Moral Stories on the wall... A seating capacity of range 70-80.. Attendants in South Indian attire.. Some slow south Indian music.. \nI cunningly smsed Zomato and took the 15%discount before going ;)\n\nOrdered 1 Erupi(Onion) masala dosa.. got 1 papad and a glass of rasam as a complimentary beverage.. 3 chutneys and Sambhar.. Big Dosa.. It was big enough for me (My diet is more than medium), so cancelled the plan of having uttapam..  \n\nTaste was very good, nicely served.. Couldn't Find the arrogance as mentioned in other Reviews, atleast at hauz khas village's Unit.. They readily took my Discount Sms and my bill was reduced from 94/- INR to 81/- INR.. \n\nservice was quick n good... the only problem was 2 kids shouting at top of their voice.. so if u have kids please control them so that others don't get disturbed...  \n\nI recommend atleast 1 visit to the place... I went alone.:(\nNext time i would be taking my mallu friends along..."
